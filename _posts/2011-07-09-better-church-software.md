title: Better Church Software

I have a head full of ideas for writing better church software, and I don't know
really where to start. *Though, I know I need to talk through some of it before
I just start coding (thus the reason for this blog).*
            
First, I think most Church Management Software (ChMS) solves **the wrong problem.**
Ministers of the gospel don't need a database to track minutia -- they need a system to
help them **engage** their members, produce volunteers, and most important,
draw people to Christ. I haven't yet found a ChMS that does any of that well (or at all).

Sure, having at least a *list* of your members is a must -- you don't want anyone
to slip through the cracks. But the *database* of the system should be a means to an end,
not an end in and of itself.

When churches feel the need to hire a secretarial staff member whose sole responsibility
is to *manage the database* (let's call it Management of the Church Management System,
or MoChMS for short), I think that's proof that we've failed as Christian software engineers.
      
I have the opinion that *ministers* and *pastors* should [want to] be using
the software themselves. The software should be an extension of their work -- it should
support them -- and not the other way around.
    
And I think part of the reason that MoChMS has become such a common need is because
most church software has very poor user interface (UI) and, more importantly, poor
user experience (UX). They're largely overgrown databases with different features
("modules" as they're often called) bolted on top. No wonder no minister
wants to touch it. Managing the database is an afterthought for most.
  
I'm not sure I know how to fix all this, but I tend to blame the poor UX for
generating a certain feeling of dread that most staff have toward even
firing up their ChMS.


And for these reasons (and many others I don't yet want to bore you with),
I have half a mind to write church software that **solves the right problem** and has
**excellent UX**.

*Stay tuned; there's more to come in a future post...*
