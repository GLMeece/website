### First Version

I'm proud to announce that [Profiles](http://github.com/churchio/profiles) 0.1.0 has
been tagged<sup>1</sup>, aka "Allegheny"<sup>2</sup>.

With this version comes the basics:

* Log in with Facebook.
* Create a profile with a snazzy background image and your contact info.
* Search by name.

And quite possibly the best feature of all: Profiles can now be deployed to
[Heroku](http://www.heroku.com), the amazing, free<sup>3</sup>
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for hosting web applications.

Check out the new [installation instructions](/profiles/install.html) to see
what's gone into making this one of the easiest Rails apps to install (thanks
mostly to Heroku's deployment process).

<sup>1</sup> I'm trying to avoid the term "release" since that might imply that the source code was *withheld*.

<sup>2</sup> Versions are named after [Tulsa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa,_Oklahoma) streets.

<sup>3</sup> Heroku lets you host a small app with modest needs (such as Profiles) for free.

### Website

Also, I've transitioned the site from an oft-neglected blog to a landing page
for the community of Church.IO and the Profiles app (with hopefully more apps
in the future).

I'm really hoping to make the Church.IO name into a brand that represents
quality and giving and freedom. With your help, we can improve the standard
for what qualifies as church software.

If you have ideas for improving the website, *please* let me know!
