### First Version

I'm proud to announce that [Profiles](http://github.com/churchio/profiles) 0.1.0 has
been tagged<sup>1</sup>, aka "Allegheny"<sup>2</sup>.

With this version comes the basics:

* Log in with Facebook.
* Create a profile with a snazzy background image and your contact info.
* Search by name.

And quite possibly the best feature of all: Profiles can now be deployed to
[Heroku](http://www.heroku.com), the amazing, free<sup>3</sup>
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for hosting web applications.

Check out the new [installation instructions](/profiles/install.html) to see
what's gone into making this one of the easiest Rails apps to install (thanks
mostly to Heroku's deployment process).

<sup>1</sup> I'm trying to avoid the term "release" since that might imply that the source code was *withheld*.

<sup>2</sup> Versions are named after [Tulsa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa,_Oklahoma) streets.

<sup>3</sup> Heroku lets you host a small app with modest needs (such as Profiles) for free.

### Website

Also, I've transitioned the site from an oft-neglected blog to a landing page
for the community of Church.IO and the Profiles app (with hopefully more apps
in the future).

[![Website Screenshot](/images/screenshots/website.small.jpg)](/images/screenshots/website.jpg)

The new website is all static content, generated by [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
(a great project you should check out if you're unfamiliar).
The source code for this site is at
[github.com/churchio/website](https://github.com/churchio/website).

The blog now lives at [/blog](/blog) and will hopefully become a place for lots of people
to express their experiences with and ideas about church software.

Since the site is no longer hosted by [Posterous](http://posterous.com), your email-based
subscription will no longer work. You'll need to subscribe to updates via the
[atom feed](/atom.xml) or just check the site regularly. ;-)

### The Future

This site and the *Profiles* project is just the scratching the surface of where I want to
take Church.IO.

I'm really hoping to make the Church.IO name into a brand that represents
quality and giving and freedom. With your help, we can improve the standard
for what qualifies as great church software. *Will you help me?*

If you have ideas for improving the website, *please* let me know!
