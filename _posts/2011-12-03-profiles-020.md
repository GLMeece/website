Hello, friends. I'm happy to make Church.IO Profiles 0.2.0, aka "Archer" available for
download.

Head over to the [Install](/profiles/install.html) page to install for the first time or
to upgrade your existing app (scroll down to the [Upgrade](/profiles/install.html#upgrade)
section).

### Better email support

* Non Facebook users can now send/receive email via the website.
* The forgotten password form now works as expected.
* Admins now get email notification when profiles are created.

* At-a-glance analytics to show community growth.
* Improved layout and styling.

* Manage roles (more to come).
* Manage notifications (more to come).

## More to come...

There's more to come. We have several warts to fix, and some new functionality
coming down the road, so stay tuned!

As always, your feedback is welcome and encouraged!
